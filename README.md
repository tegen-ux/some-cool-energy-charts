I made some cool energy-related charts when I was in [ECON 366](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/econ/366), and I've always wanted to share them. So, because I didn't want to share my source code with future students, I decided to just take the images and put them into a [Markdown file](https://github.com/tegen-ux/some-cool-energy-charts/blob/main/charts.md).

Thank you for checking it out!
